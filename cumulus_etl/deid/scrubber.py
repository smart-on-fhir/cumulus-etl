    Manages de-identification for FHIR resources.

    This usually involves holding a mapping of true IDs to fake IDs and removing identifying attributes from resources.

    It's meant to persist throughout the whole de-identification process (to keep the ID mappings around, across
    resources).

    Scrubbing happens in two phases:
    1. Bulk de-identification of all the input data early on. This is a first pass for almost everything (except IDs,
       notes, and sundries that Cumulus actually wants to see). Dates of birth are generalized, for example, and lots
       of PHI attributes like names or contact info is redacted. After this call, the data is partially de-identified.
    2. Per-resource de-identification as Cumulus inspects each resource. This is to give Cumulus more control over the
       bits of PHI data that it actually cares about (like IDs or notes) before this final scrub here. After this call,
       the resource is fully de-identified.
