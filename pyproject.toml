# These dependencies are mostly pinned to be under the next major version.
# That makes particular sense as long as we don't have official releases yet and our code is used
# by pulling from main directly.
# But now there's a risk of missing a major release and bit-rotting the dependency tree.
#
# We should either (a) configure a bot to warn us about stale dependencies, or
# (b) once we switch to a more planned release schedule (via docker or similar), just go back to
# open-pinned dependencies so that we're more likely to notice new releases (we'll still have time
# to fix any breakages since users won't immediately see the problem).
